# blog-rust

My first blog system in rust it doesn't include create_account nor view threads just because I was getting sick of working on this project.

Not the best code, very rough. Heavyily relies on Postgres.

Point of this project was for me to get use to the rust and postgres ecosystem; and a variety of useful libraries.

I'm publishing this project because I think it might help someone who's just starting to get into rust from a noob's perspective.
